##Introductions
Hi There, My name is Preetha. I am a front-end web and interaction designer from San Diego, California.

My background is in software engineering but I am really passionate about designs, both creating and building them on the web. I am currently learning advanced web development in San Diego Continuing Education College. I also love to create hand-crafts whenever I have the time from personal items.

###Things I like to do:
* Create designs using photoshop
* Travel
* Paint or pencil sketch
* Make personal treasure items
* Blog about my creations
